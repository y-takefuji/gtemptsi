# gtemptsi

gtemptsi is a PyPI application for visualizing four lines of global surface temperature and total solar irradiance, and their linear-regression lines with R-squared, slope and intercept, and p-value.

NOAA started total solar irradiance (TSI) measurement from 1978. 
The global surface temperature and TSI are publicly available at the NOAA sites. 

TSI ('W$m^-2$'): https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/total-solar-irradiance/access/monthly/

Global surface temperature (K:Kelvin): https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/noaa-global-surface-temperature/v5.1/access/timeseries/

gtemptsi download datasets automatically and save them as tsi.csv (TSI dataset) and noaa.csv (global surface temperature dataset).

# How to install gtemptsi

$ pip install gtemptsi

# How to run gtemptsi
<pre>
$ gtemptsi
Enter the beginning year-month (e.g. 1978-11): 1996-06
Enter the end year-month (e.g. 2023-03): 1998-12

solid line: global surface temperature
dotted line: linear regression of temperature
dashed line: TSI
dashdot line: linear regression of TSI
